Wearable neurotechnology is increasingly used in consumer and clinical settings, demanding reliable real-time assessment
of cognitive effort and stress. Multimodal sensingparticularly electroencephalography (EEG) combined with functional
near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)offers richer, complementary insights over unimodal approaches. This study presents
a lightweight, interpretable pipeline for trial-wise classification of motivational stress versus cognitive ease using a public
simultaneous EEGfNIRS dataset (16 healthy adults; 3,044 analyzable trials). We introduce a physiology-augmented
labeling strategy that integrates task structure with a subject-specific EffortIndex, computed from normalized α-ERD,
frontal θ power, and prefrontal HbO in decision windows. Labels are automatically assigned to reduce manual annotation
while capturing inter-individual variability. Under a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) evaluation protocol, we train a classbalanced logistic model with train-only standardization and threshold tuning. Results show that early EEGfNIRS fusion
achieves a macro AUC of 0.76, F1 of 0.69, and average precision (AP) of 0.71, consistently outperforming single-modality
baselines across metrics. The linear model provides transparent physiological attribution aligned with known neural stress
markers. The proposed method forms a reproducible, edge-ready framework for cognitive state monitoring in wearable
neurotechnology.
